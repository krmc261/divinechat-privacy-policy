  <h1>Privacy Policy for DivineChat</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    DivineChat is a mobile application intended to provide educational and faith-based conversational experiences with simulated biblical figures. This privacy policy outlines how we handle any data processed or encountered during use of the application.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    DivineChat does not collect or store personally identifiable information (PII). We do not ask for your name, email, address, phone number, or other personal identifiers. We do not store any user messages or behavioral tracking data on our servers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Input</h2>
  <p>
    User input is temporarily sent to OpenAI’s API in order to generate a conversational response. These interactions are not stored by DivineChat. OpenAI may retain data temporarily to monitor for abuse or to improve model performance. For full details, see <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank">OpenAI’s Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Mental Health and Crisis Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    DivineChat is not a medical, psychological, or therapeutic service. If you are in crisis, experiencing distress, or considering self-harm, please seek immediate help from a licensed mental health provider or call the National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at <strong>988</strong> (in the U.S.). For international support, visit <a href="https://www.befrienders.org" target="_blank">www.befrienders.org</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    No responses generated by DivineChat are intended to replace professional care, counseling, or diagnosis. Conversations are entirely simulated and generated by AI for educational and spiritual exploration only.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    DivineChat uses OpenAI’s API to generate responses. We do not use advertising SDKs, analytics platforms, or third-party tracking tools. No third-party has access to user messages outside the temporary API processing described above.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    DivineChat is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under this age. If a parent or guardian believes a child has submitted personal information, they should contact us immediately to ensure data is removed.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights and Data Control</h2>
  <p>
    Because DivineChat does not store user data, there is no user-identifiable content to modify, access, or delete. You maintain full control of the app’s usage from your device.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    While DivineChat does not store personal information, we rely on OpenAI’s infrastructure to process chat content securely. OpenAI implements robust security measures to protect any transient data they process.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may revise this policy from time to time. Any significant changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
