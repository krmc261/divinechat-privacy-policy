  <h1>Privacy Policy for DivineChat</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store any personal information. You can use DivineChat without creating an account or submitting any identifying information.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Input</h2>
  <p>
    When you type a message in the app, it is temporarily sent to a third-party AI provider (OpenAI) to generate a response. The message is <strong>not stored</strong> by us and is not linked to your identity. No chats are saved on our servers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    DivineChat uses the OpenAI API to process conversations. Refer to <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a> for more details. We do not integrate with advertising SDKs or analytics tools.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    DivineChat is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe your child has submitted personal information, please contact us.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Since we do not collect personal data, there is nothing to access, modify, or delete. All data remains on your device or within temporary API processing.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. Any changes will be posted here, with a new effective date.
